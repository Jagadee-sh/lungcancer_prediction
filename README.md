Predicting lung cancer survival based on clinical data using machine learning
Highlights
•
An outline for future research in lung cancer survival prediction.

•
The majority of reviewed studies did not address missing data, normalization, scaling, or standardization.

•
Machine learning models need to be chosen according to the characteristics of the dataset.


Abstract
Machine learning has gained popularity in predicting survival time in the medical field. This review examines studies utilizing machine learning and data-mining techniques to predict lung cancer survival using clinical data. A systematic literature review searched MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, following reporting guidelines and using the COVIDENCE system. Studies published from 2000 to 2023 employing machine learning for lung cancer survival prediction were included. Risk of bias assessment used the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool. Thirty studies were reviewed, with 13 (43.3%) using the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database. Missing data handling was addressed in 12 (40%) studies, primarily through data transformation and conversion. Feature selection algorithms were used in 19 (63.3%) studies, with age, sex, and N stage being the most chosen features. Random forest was the predominant machine learning model, used in 17 (56.6%) studies. While the number of lung cancer survival prediction studies is limited, the use of machine learning models based on clinical data has grown since 2012. Consideration of diverse patient cohorts and data pre-processing are crucial. Notably, most studies did not account for missing data, normalization, scaling, or standardized data, potentially introducing bias. Therefore, a comprehensive study on lung cancer survival prediction using clinical data is needed, addressing these challenges.
